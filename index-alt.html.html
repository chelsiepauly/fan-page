Of Monsters and Men is a indie folk-pop band from Keflav&iacute;k, Icleand. This band has five main members, along with other on tour members. Of Monsters and Men has a very unique sound, songs that lift you up, and the songs that everyone can relate to. Lead singer/guitarist Nanna Brynd&iacute;s Hilmarsd&oacute;ttir and co-singer-guitarist Ragnar "Raggi" &thorn;&oacute;rhallsson create such a beautiful, one of a kind harmony when singing together, and also seperately. Guitarist Brynjar Leifsson, drummer Arnar R&oacute;senkranz Hilmarsson and bassist Kristj&aacute;n P&aacute;ll Kristj&aacute;nsson help to create the astounding sound of this magical, indie folk-pop band from Keflav√≠k. They are amazing live, and out of all new bands as of 2010, this is definitely one to check out. A sound and harmony heard like never before.
